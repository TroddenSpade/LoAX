# react-native-modal

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modal.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modal)
[![styled with prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled_with-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

An enhanced, animated and customizable react-native modal.

The aim of `react-native-modal` is expanding the original react-native `Modal` component by adding animations and styles customization options while still providing a plain-simple API.

## Features

- Smooth enter/exit animations
- Plain simple and flexible APIs
- Customizable backdrop opacity, color and timing
- Listeners for the modal animations ending
- Resize itself correctly on device rotation
- Swipeable
- Scrollable

## Setup

This library is available on npm, install it with: `npm install --save react-native-modal` or `yarn add react-native-modal`.

## Usage

Since react-native-modal is an extension of the original react native modal, it works in a similar fashion [react-native original modal](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html).

1.  Import react-native-modal:

```javascript
import Modal from "react-native-modal";
```

2.  Create a modal and nest its content inside of it:

```javascript
render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <Modal>
          <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
          </View>
        </Modal>
      </View>
    )
  }
```

3.  Then simply show it by setting the `isVisible` prop to true:

```javascript
render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <Modal isVisible={true}>
          <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
          </View>
        </Modal>
      </View>
    )
  }
```

The `isVisible` prop is the only prop you'll really need to make the modal work: you should control this prop value by saving it in your state and setting it to `true` or `false` when needed.

## A complete example

The following example consists in a component (`ModalTester`) with a button and a modal.
The modal is controlled by the `isModalVisible` state variable and it is initially hidden, since its value is `false`.  
Pressing the button sets `isModalVisible` to true, making the modal visible.  
Inside the modal there is another button that, when pressed, sets `isModalVisible` to false, hiding the modal.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from "react-native";
import Modal from "react-native-modal";

export default class ModalTester extends Component {
  state = {
    isModalVisible: false,
  };

  _toggleModal = () =>
    this.setState({ isModalVisible: !this.state.isModalVisible });

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._toggleModal}>
          <Text>Show Modal</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <Modal isVisible={this.state.isModalVisible}>
          <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Text>Hello!</Text>
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._toggleModal}>
              <Text>Hide me!</Text>
            </TouchableOpacity>
          </View>
        </Modal>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

For a more complex example take a look at the `/example` directory.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The component is not working as expected

Under the hood `react-native-modal` uses react-native original [Modal component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html).  
Before reporting a bug, try swapping `react-native-modal` with react-native original Modal component and, if the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a [react-native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).

### The backdrop is not completely filled/covered on some Android devices (Galaxy, for one)

React-Native has a few issues detecting the correct device width/height of some devices.  
If you're experiencing this issue, you'll need to install [`react-native-extra-dimensions-android`](https://github.com/Sunhat/react-native-extra-dimensions-android).  
Then, provide the real window height (obtained from `react-native-extra-dimensions-android`) to the modal:

```javascript
render() {
  const deviceWidth = Dimensions.get("window").width;
  const deviceHeight = Platform.OS === "ios"
    ? Dimensions.get("window").height
    : require("react-native-extra-dimensions-android").get("REAL_WINDOW_HEIGHT");

  return (
  <Modal
    isVisible={this.state.isVisible}
    deviceWidth={deviceWidth}
    deviceHeight={deviceHeight}
  >
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
    </View>
  </Modal>
  )
}
```

### How can I hide the modal by pressing outside of its content?

The prop `onBackdropPress` allows you to handle this situation:

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={this.state.isVisible}
  onBackdropPress={() => this.setState({ isVisible: false })}>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

### How can I hide the modal by swiping it?

The prop `onSwipeComplete` allows you to handle this situation (remember to set `swipeDirection` too!):

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={this.state.isVisible}
  onSwipeComplete={() => this.setState({ isVisible: false })}
  swipeDirection="left">
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

Note that when using `useNativeDriver={true}` the modal won't drag correctly. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/163#issuecomment-409760695).

### The modal flashes in a weird way when animating

Unfortunately this is a [know issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/92) that happens when `useNativeDriver=true` and must still be solved.  
In the meanwhile as a workaround you can set the `hideModalContentWhileAnimating` prop to `true`: this seems to solve the issue.
Also, do not assign a `backgroundColor` property directly to the Modal. Prefer to set it on the child container.

### The modal background doesn't animate properly

Are you sure you named the `isVisible` prop correctly? Make sure it is spelled correctly: `isVisible`, not `visible`.

### The modal doesn't change orientation

Add a `supportedOrientations={['portrait', 'landscape']}` prop to the component, as described [in the React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html#supportedorientations).

Also, if you're providing the `deviceHeight` and `deviceWidth` props you'll have to manually update them when the layout changes.

### I can't show multiple modals one after another

Unfortunately right now react-native doesn't allow multiple modals to be displayed at the same time.
This means that, in `react-native-modal`, if you want to immediately show a new modal after closing one you must first make sure that the modal that your closing has completed its hiding animation by using the `onModalHide` prop.

### I can't show multiple modals at the same time

See the question above.
Showing multiple modals (or even alerts/dialogs) at the same time is not doable because of a react-native bug.
That said, I would strongly advice against using multiple modals at the same time because, most often than not, this leads to a bad UX, especially on mobile (just my opinion).

### The StatusBar style changes when the modal shows up

This issue has ben discussed [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/50).  
The TLDR is: it's a know React-Native issue with the Modal component ðŸ˜ž

### The modal is not covering the entire screen

The modal style applied by default has a small margin.  
If you want the modal to cover the entire screen you can easily override it this way:

```js
<Modal style={{ margin: 0 }}>...</Modal>
```

### I can't scroll my ScrollView inside of the modal

Enable propagateSwipe to allow your child components to receive swipe events:

```js
<Modal propagateSwipe>...</Modal>
```

Please notice that this is still a WIP fix and might not fix your issue yet, see [issue #236](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/236).

## Available animations

Take a look at [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable) to see the dozens of animations available out-of-the-box. You can also pass in custom animation definitions and have them automatically register with react-native-animatable. For more information on creating custom animations, see the react-native-animatable [animation definition schema](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable#animation-definition-schema).
