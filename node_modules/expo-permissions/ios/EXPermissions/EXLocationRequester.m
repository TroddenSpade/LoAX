    // 1. Why do we call CLLocationManager methods by those dynamically created selectors?
    //
    //    Most probably application code submitted to Apple Store is statically analyzed
    //    paying special attention to camelcase(request_always_location) being called on CLLocationManager.
    //    This lets Apple warn developers when it notices that location authorization may be requested
    //    while there is no NSLocationUsageDescription in Info.plist. Since we want to neither
    //    make Expo developers receive this kind of messages nor add our own default usage description,
    //    we try to fool the static analyzer and construct the selector in runtime.
    //    This way behavior of this requester is governed by provided NSLocationUsageDescriptions.
    //
    // 2. Why there's no way to call specifically whenInUse or always authorization?
    //
    //    The requester sets itself as the delegate of the CLLocationManager, so when the user responds
    //    to a permission requesting dialog, manager calls `locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus:` method.
    //    To be precise, manager calls this method in two circumstances:
    //      - right when `request*Authorization` method is called,
    //      - when `authorizationStatus` changes.
    //    With this behavior we aren't able to support the following use case:
    //      - app requests `whenInUse` authorization
    //      - user allows `whenInUse` authorization
    //      - `authorizationStatus` changes from `undetermined` to `whenInUse`, callback is called, promise is resolved
    //      - app wants to escalate authorization to `always`
    //      - user selects `whenInUse` authorization (iOS 11+)
    //      - `authorizationStatus` doesn't change, so callback is not called and requester can't know whether
    //        user responded to the dialog selecting `whenInUse` or is still deciding
    //    To support this use case we will have to change the way location authorization is requested
    //    from promise-based to listener-based.
